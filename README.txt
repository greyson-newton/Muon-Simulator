To run multiple simulations on the same window, after first simulation has completed click 
the RESET Btn, change whatever parameters needed for the new simulation, then click the START Btn 
to begin next simulation. 

Each simulation adds an entry to a text file named "Log" detailing the parameters and the time it took 
to complete. To view the log, click the LOG Btn.

Future Changes: add different alignment algorithms and test the efficiency of each algorithm.
